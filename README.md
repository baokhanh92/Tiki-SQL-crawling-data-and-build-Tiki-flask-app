## About the code 

**In order to be able to duplicate Tiki and show them on our site, we break the hard job into two main steps:

   **1. Scrawl data on Tiki and stores them in Postgres SQL under 2 tables:
   
     - Categories: scrawl all category on Tiki.vn
     - Products: scrawl products from 4 categorie
    Source file: jupyter notebook


   **2. Connect the database to flask app and format HTML file:

     - HTML : see templates folder
     - Code: we break into 3 python files: 
         - app.py: flask app 
         - models.py: create object and information that needed to show on the HTML file
         - config.py: store the database address
